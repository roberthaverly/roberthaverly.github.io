        <h1>Work</h1>

        <p>Recently, my work has been almost entirely on the operational and management side, though my current goal is to return to more hands-on design. Here's a fun timeline:</p>

        <section>
            <h4>1998 &rarr; 2008: HTML2/CSS1/DHTML/JS/PHP.</h4>
            <p>The hard knox of webdev. When people meme about the hellscape of IE3 and Netscape Navigator, this is the era they're talking about. This was essentially CSS beta. During this time, I was working directly with the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) and the CSS WG (CSS Working Group) to test, hack, and find the pathway to modern CSS implementation. This was the era of HTML 2.0, "dynamic HTML" (ðŸ˜†), and CSS level 1. <em>#allTheThings: position: absolute;</em></p>
        
            <h4>2008 &rarr; 2012: HTML3/CSS2/JS, Photoshop, Illustrator, Fireworks, Flash</h4>
            <p>As mobile started to, well... exist, I became fairly infatuated with the concept of tiny portable computers. By the time Apple had released their first phone, the handful of us that were nerdy enough to have access to earlier touch devices, were already knee-deep in conceptual work. Watching the term "user experience" [finally] emerge was one of the most defining moments in my career. This is also when I started transitioning out of engineering full-time, and in to dedicaated design roles at smaller companies and web agencies.</p>
        
            <h4>2012 &rarr; 2016: Xcode, Android Studio, Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch, Zeplin</h4>
            <p>Edging my way in to bigger companies like PayPal and YouTube, hanging out in swankier offices, and creeping closer toward director roles at agencies, these four years were an absolute whirlwind of hyper-focusing on mobile and "product design" as the craft started to become a cohesive idea that people could understand, get behind, and give a budget to. I worked on bigger projects, I worked toward bigger goals, and I succeeded and failed at the highest levels that I had thus far in my career.</p>
