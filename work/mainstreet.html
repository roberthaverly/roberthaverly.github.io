            <h1>MainStreet</h1>
            <p>MainStreet is a great startup, with a great team, working to get other startups tax credits painfully and quickly. The logistics of upfront payments and incremental billing and deposits, make for complex problems on the experience side as well as on the product as a whole.</p>
            <p>Beyond design work, which mostly revolved around creating their initial design system, my primary role to build the design team up from myself and the design director, to 4 lead-level ICs.</p>

        <p>Having a design system in place was vital to get the future team up and running as quickly as possible. In our case, it was fairly rudimentary due to the fact that not a lot of product work was at a stage where we could consider it "done" yet. Nonethless we put together a design system using Figma and Atomic Design patterns, which comprised of core elements, styles, and interactive components</p>
